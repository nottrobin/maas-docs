Todo:
- can add more user-friendly instructions on setting up local web server
- talk about entr utility

Every non-trivial contribution must first have its HTML built and verified before a pull request (PR) is made from it.

See the [documentation-builder project](https://github.com/CanonicalLtd/documentation-builder) for details of the actual tool.

<h2 id="heading--installation">Installation</h2>

Install the builder. On Ubuntu 16.04 LTS:

``` bash
sudo snap install documentation-builder
```

[note]
You will first need to install package `squashfuse` if you're doing this in a LXD container.
[/note]

To build the HTML, while in the root of the MAAS docs repository:

``` bash
documentation-builder
```

<h2 id="heading--verification">Verification</h2>

You can point a web browser at individual HTML files but to make your verification more conclusive you will need a web server.

<h3 id="heading--web-server">Web server</h3>

See the [Ubuntu Server Guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/httpd.html) for instructions on setting up Apache. The DocumentRoot should be the `build` directory. To test, point your browser at:

``` no-highlight
http://127.0.0.1/en/contributing.html
```

Alternatively, you can use Python to start a simple HTTP server (port 8000). While in the `build` directory run:

``` bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

With Python 3:

``` bash
python3 -m http.server
```

<h3 id="heading--points-to-consider">Points to consider</h3>

Some things to consider during verification:

-   A linkchecker (either a system-wide tool or a [browser add-on](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/check-my-links/ojkcdipcgfaekbeaelaapakgnjflfglf))
-   Images should show enough context (surrounding real estate) but not so much to make important details illegible.
